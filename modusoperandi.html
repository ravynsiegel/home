        <h1>Modus Operandi</h1>
        <p id="define">/ˌmōdəs ˌäpəˈrandē,ˌmōdəs ˌäpəˈrandī/<br>
        <i><b>noun</b><br>
        a particular way or method of doing something, 
        especially one that is characteristic or well-established.</i></p>

        <h2>Nothing in life requires talent to be successful.</h2>

        <p>I’ve lifted myself and those around me up with the belief that anyone 
        can learn anything, and talent is not a requirement—or accurate indicator—of a person’s success.<br>
        This simple, pragmatic approach to life is more than just words of encouragement:
        it is upheld by the psychological phenomenon known as neuroplasticity, 
        which is the brain’s ability to grow.<br>

        By carrying out this principle throughout daily life, I've dismantled the self-limiting and damaging 
        belief that success is determined by a person’s inherent qualities. 
        In actuality, success begins with believing that intelligence and talent are not innately fixed, 
        but reliant on the ability to work hard and trust in one's own capabilities.<br></p>

        <h2>How I do one thing is how I do all things.</h2>

        <p>This principle is reflected in everything I do, including work ethic.<br>
        I have a keen eye for spotting flaws in preexisting systems 
        and enjoy the challenge of breaking down large, 
        complex, and nuanced issues into more approachable, manageable tasks. 
        Just like with learning anything new—it's easiest to do in small steps.<br>

        On a team, I believe in nurturing the strengths of others and myself through constructive criticism 
        and view my own role as one individual contributing to a greater whole.
        I recognize that it’s only through close collaboration with others that I’m able to deliver positive change
        to a large audience. While some people may shy away from the pressure of being 
        relied on in a group, I thrive—stepping up to the plate with the mindset that my human error, mistakes, 
        and shortcomings are simply opportunities for growth.</p>
